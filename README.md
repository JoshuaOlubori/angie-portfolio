# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## 📝 Project Description
This project conducts an analysis of COVID-19 pandemic data. It encompasses aspects of data science such as data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The  objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw COVID-19 datasets and present them in an intuitive graphical format.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

### 📌 Data Loading and Inspection
- Importing diverse datasets (primarily CSV files) into Pandas DataFrames.
- Conducting initial data inspections to understand structure, detect missing values, and identify data types.

### 📌 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handling missing or inconsistent entries by:
  - Filling null values
  - Converting data types
  - Merging datasets based on common identifiers (e.g., Country/Region, Province/State, ObservationDate)
- Feature engineering such as calculating **Active Cases** using Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered figures.

### 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Grouping and aggregating data to discover trends and patterns:
  - Tracking confirmed, death, and recovery counts globally over time.
  - Analyzing by Country/Region and Province/State to locate hotspots.
  - Filtering countries with high death tolls.

### 📌 Data Visualization
- Utilizing rich visual techniques to convey data clearly:
  - **Line Plots:** Showing global trends in confirmed cases over time.
  - **Bar Plots:** Comparing deaths or active cases by region (e.g., US states).
  - **Multi-Line Plots:** Tracking multiple metrics (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active) across high-impact countries.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Google Colab**
